## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **"No geographic data yet"**
**Causes:**
- Site just launched (no visitors yet)
- All visitors are local (127.0.0.1)
- Geolocation API is down

**Solutions:**
- Wait for real visitors
- Test from different devices/networks
- Check internet connection on server

### **"Local" showing for all visitors**
**Causes:**
- Testing on localhost (127.0.0.1)
- Behind corporate proxy
- VPN blocking geolocation

**Solutions:**
- Deploy to PythonAnywhere
- Test from mobile phone (4G/5G)
- Ask friends to visit from different locations

### **Inaccurate city data**
**Causes:**
- Mobile networks show carrier location
- VPNs show VPN server location
- Some ISPs use central routing

**Solutions:**
- Focus on country-level data (more accurate)
- Use city data as a guide, not absolute truth
- Combine with other data (referrers, etc.)
