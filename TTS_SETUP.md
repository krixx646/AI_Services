## 💡 **How It Works:**

1. User clicks **"Listen"** button
2. Frontend sends text to `/api/blog/tts/`
3. Backend uses `edge-tts` library
4. Microsoft Edge TTS generates audio (via their public API)
5. Returns MP3 audio to browser
6. HTML5 audio player plays it

**Technical Note**: Edge TTS uses Microsoft's public endpoint (same one Edge browser uses). It's free and unlimited because it's designed for accessibility.

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **"TTS error" or audio not playing:**
- ✅ Check server console for errors
- ✅ Verify `edge-tts` is installed: `pip list | grep edge-tts`
- ✅ Try shorter blog posts first
- ✅ System will fallback to Web Speech API automatically

### **Audio quality sounds robotic:**
- ✅ Verify you're using Edge TTS (check browser console, should say "Loading...")
- ✅ If it says "Listen" without loading, Edge TTS is working
- ✅ If voice sounds robotic, it's using Web Speech API (fallback)

### **Slow generation:**
- ✅ First request takes 3-5 seconds (normal)
- ✅ Check internet connection
- ✅ Reduce text length (< 5000 chars recommended)

## 🎯 **Advanced: Custom Voice Settings:**

```python
async def generate_audio():
    communicate = edge_tts.Communicate(
        text, 
        voice,
        rate='+10%',      # Speed: -50% to +100%
        volume='+0%',     # Volume: -50% to +50%
        pitch='+0Hz'      # Pitch: -50Hz to +50Hz
    )
    ...
```
